      <h2>What I do💥</h2>
      <p>
        My biggest hobby (and passion) is <strong>nature</strong>🍃
        where I like to hike or just be in the mountains.
        I also love extreme sports like climbing,
        snowboarding and windsurfing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we don't have mountains in the Netherlands,
        I do lots of indoor climbing.
        That's for sure the activity I spend most of my time doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from that, I am a seasoned Duolingo learner🦉
        My current streak is 1074 days🔥.
        I mainly focus on learning <strong>Spanish🇪🇸</strong> -
        occasionally Portuguese🇵🇹, which is super hard -
        and try to combine the Duolingo lessons
        with real-world practice and things like
        watching movies in Spanish.

      <p>
        As I said, nature is my biggest passion.
        My second biggest passion is probably my <strong><u>cats</u></strong>,
        but I also like <u>movies</u>, <u>games</u> with a good storyline
        and writing <u>poetry</u>.

      <h2>What I've done🤓</h2>
      <p>
        One of my main projects is doing
        what I'm doing right now: learning how to code,
        build websites etc.
        I've been trying to learn the basics of <strong>Web Development</strong>
        and <strong>UX/UI Design</strong> in my free time, next to my full-time job.
        As this wasn't very successful,
        I decided to commit to a career change
        using Le Wagon as starting point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some other projects I did:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Building my own single-speed bike🚴🏼‍♂️</li>
          <li>Producing my own bio-based windsurf fin🏄🏻</li>
          <li><s>Learning how to ollie</s>🛹</li>
      </ul>
